# Interactive Quiz Project

![Interactive Quiz Screenshot](screenshot.png) <!-- Placeholder for a screenshot -->

A modern, interactive quiz application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz features a sleek design with a glassmorphism effect, a circular scoreboard, and a question-per-page layout to enhance user focus and engagement. Users can start the quiz, answer questions within a 60-second timer, and view their results on a dedicated score screen with a dynamic circular progress ring.

## Features

- **Start Screen**: A "Start Quiz" button initiates the quiz, hiding itself upon starting.
- **Question-per-Page Layout**: Displays one question at a time with "Previous" and "Next" navigation buttons. The "Submit" button appears on the last question.
- **Timer with Progress Bar**: A 60-second timer with a visual progress bar. The timer turns red when 10 seconds remain, and the quiz auto-submits when time runs out.
- **Answer Persistence**: User answers are stored and preserved as they navigate between questions, ensuring accurate scoring.
- **Score Screen**: A dedicated screen displays the userâ€™s score with:
  - A hollow circular scoreboard that animates to fill based on the score percentage (e.g., 60% for 3 out of 5).
  - The score (e.g., "3/5") in the center of the ring.
  - A text summary of the score and a warning for unanswered questions.
  - A "Try Again" button to restart the quiz.
- **Modern Design**:
  - Gradient background and glassmorphism effect for the quiz container.
  - Poppins font for typography.
  - Teal accent color (`#00c4b4`) for buttons, progress bars, and the scoreboard.
  - Hover effects on buttons and answer options.
  - Animations for quiz content (fade-in), score screen (slide-in), and high scores (pulsing effect).
- **Responsive**: The quiz is fully responsive and works on various screen sizes.
